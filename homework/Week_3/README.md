Description:
    It works for all requirements.
    
Comments:
1. Rewriting the createTransform function to a more efficient function
2. Create an x-axis that uses calendar dates (instead of days since the first date in the data set)
3. The index.html and README.md in the root of repository are not clear for me. I try my best.
