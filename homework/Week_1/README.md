    It works for all requirements
    
Comments:
 1. Actors column does not include directors, which is different from what shown in the output.csv. I think just stars belong to actors.
 2. Use different method from given method to output to the csv and input from the csv
 3. design two figures, one is a line chart, the other is a pie chart. (it shows and saves as "visualizer.png")
